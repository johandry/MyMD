Vemos en esta película a mamás, papás, directores, maestros, funcionarios, representantes sindicales y líderes de opinión que trazan un cuadro global que no permite la indiferencia. Los datos, las entrevistas y lo que los propios alumnos filmaron con cámaras de mano dan pie a una indignación inteligente y también a darse cuenta de la parte que a cada uno le toca aportar. El proyecto se desarrolló por tres años entrando en la realidad de los alumnos y sus familias, captando la dinámica cotidiana de escuelas en lugares tan diversos del territorio nacional como Ciudad Juárez, el interior de Yucatán, Morelia, las sierras de Chiapas y Guerrero, así como Naucalpan e Iztapalapa en la zona metropolitana de la Ciudad de México.","-- United States","","Juan Carlos Rulfo, Carlos Loret de Mola","","Carlos Loret de Mola, Mario Gutiérrez Vega","Movie","/Volumes/Media Center/Shared iTunes/iTunes Media/Movies/!De Panzazo!/!De Panzazo!.m4v"

They are, by all accounts, an average couple living a normal life in the suburbs with their young son…until a mysterious man with a horribly disfigured face appears on their doorstep and presents Norma with a life-altering proposition: the box. With only 24 hours to make their choice, Norma and Arthur face an impossible moral dilemma. What they don’t realize is that no matter what they decide, terrifying consequences will have already been set in motion.
