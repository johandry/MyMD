Vemos en esta película a mamás, papás, directores, maestros, funcionarios, representantes sindicales y líderes de opinión que trazan un cuadro global que no permite la indiferencia.  Los datos, las entrevistas y lo que los propios alumnos filmaron con cámaras de mano dan pie a una indignación inteligente y también a darse cuenta de la parte que a cada uno le toca aportar.  El proyecto se desarrolló por tres años entrando en la realidad de los alumnos y sus familias, captando la dinámica cotidiana de escuelas en lugares tan diversos del territorio nacional como Ciudad Juárez, el interior de Yucatán, Morelia, las sierras de Chiapas y Guerrero, así como Naucalpan e Iztapalapa en la zona metropolitana de la Ciudad de México.\n","Encoder":"HandBrake 0.9.8 2012071800\n","??
