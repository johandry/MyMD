Vemos en esta película a mamás, papás, directores, maestros, funcionarios, representantes sindicales y líderes de opinión que trazan un cuadro global que no permite la indiferencia. Los datos, las entrevistas y lo que los propios alumnos filmaron con cámaras de mano dan pie a una indignación inteligente y también a darse cuenta de la parte que a cada uno le toca aportar. El proyecto se desarrolló por tres años entrando en la realidad de los alumnos y sus familias, captando la dinámica cotidiana de escuelas en lugares tan diversos del territorio nacional como Ciudad Juárez, el interior de Yucatán, Morelia, las sierras de Chiapas y Guerrero, así como Naucalpan e Iztapalapa en la zona metropolitana de la Ciudad de México.","","","Juan Carlos Rulfo, Carlos Loret de Mola","","Carlos Loret de Mola, Mario Gutiérrez Vega","Movie","/Volumes/Media Center/Shared iTunes/iTunes Media/Movies/!De Panzazo!/!De Panzazo!.m4v"

The victorious Nesib, Emir of Hobeika, lays down his peace terms to rival Amar, Sultan of Salmaah. The two men agree that neither can lay claim to the area of no man’s land between them called The Yellow Belt. In return, Nesib adopts Amar’s two boys Saleeh and Auda as a guarantee against invasion. Twelve years later, Saleeh and Auda have grown into young men. Saleeh, the warrior, itches to escape his gilded cage and return to his father’s land. Auda cares only for books and the pursuit of knowledge. One day, their adopted father Nesib is visited by an American from Texas. He tells the Emir that his land is blessed with oil and promises him riches beyond his wildest imagination. Nesib imagines a realm of infinite possibility, a kingdom with roads, schools and hospitals all paid for by the black gold beneath the barren sand. There is only one problem. The precious oil is located in the Yellow Belt.","","Doha Film Institute, The","Jean-Jacques Annaud","","Menno Meyjes, Jean-Jacques Annaud","Movie","/Volumes/Media Center/Shared iTunes/iTunes Media/Movies/Black Gold/Black Gold.m4v"

She lives with her obsessive former ballerina mother Erica who exerts a suffocating control over her. When artistic director Thomas Leroy decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily, who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.","0","Fox Searchlight Pictures, Protozoa Pictures Inc., Phoenix Pictures","Darren Aronofsky","","Andres Heinz, Mark Heyman","Movie","/Volumes/Media Center/Shared iTunes/iTunes Media/Movies/Black Swan/Black Swan.m4v"

There is growing evidence that vampires deprived of an adequate blood supply are themselves evolving into wild, vile creatures that attack anyone and anything in order to survive. Dr. Edward Dalton, a vampire and hematologist who works for a pharmaceutical firm, has been working on finding an artificial blood supply that will meet the vampire society's needs. He is sympathetic to humans and sees his work as a way of alleviating their suffering but his views on finding a solution change considerably when he meets someone who found a way to transform himself from being a vampire to again take human form.","0","Ethan Hawke, Sam Neill, Willem Dafoe, Claudia Karvan, Isabel Lucas, Vince Colosimo, Jay Laga'aia, Michael Dorman","Michael Spierig, Peter Spierig","Bryan Furst, Sean Furst, Chris Brown","Michael Spierig, Peter Spierig","Movie","/Volumes/Media Center/Shared iTunes/iTunes Media/Movies/Daybreakers/Daybreakers.m4v"

Working-class father John Crowley (Brendan Fraser) is finally on the fast track to corporate success when his two young children, Megan and Patrick, are diagnosed with Pompe disease -- a condition that prevents the body from breaking down sugar. In time, it disables the heart and the muscles, ultimately resulting in death. With the support of his wife, Aileen (Keri Russell), John ditches his career and teams with unconventional specialist Dr. Robert Stonehill (Harrison Ford) to found a bio-tech company and develop a cure in time to save the lives of Megan and Patrick. As Dr. Stonehill works tirelessly to prove the theories that made him the black sheep of the medical community, a powerful bond is forged between the two unlikely allies.
