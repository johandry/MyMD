    "description":"¡De Panzazo! refleja la realidad de la educación en México y pone en evidencia que la sociedad mexicana pasa de panzazo en un sistema excluyente en el que no se logran aprendizajes para la vida. Vemos en esta película a mamás, papás, directores, maestros, funcionarios, representantes sindicales y líderes de opinión que trazan un cuadro global que no permite la indiferencia. Los datos, las entrevistas y lo que los propios alumnos filmaron con cámaras de mano dan pie a una indignación inteligente y también a darse cuenta de la parte que a cada uno le toca aportar. El proyecto se desarrolló por tres años entrando en la realidad de los alumnos y sus familias, captando la dinámica cotidiana de escuelas en lugares tan diversos del territorio nacional como Ciudad Juárez, el interior de Yucatán, Morelia, las sierras de Chiapas y Guerrero, así como Naucalpan e Iztapalapa en la zona metropolitana de la Ciudad de México.",

But his faith in the new Cuba is tested: his father, a psychiatrist, can make four times as much playing piano at a hotel for foreigners; his sweetheart, Yolanda, wants a career as a dancer and longs for the riches of Miami; his younger brother Bobby simply wants to play rock music, and as a result is in constant trouble with the authorities. When Bobby takes a shocking step of revolt and Gustavo is refused service at a foreigners-only bar, the contradictions in his resolve to become a 'new man' push him to the breaking point.",

No human words are spoken here. Rather, the sights and sounds of Christmas are presented in a visual feast of whimsical, happy scenes accompanied by seasonal music. From sledding and snowmen to glowing candles and shimmering ornaments, dozens of animated and live-action settings communicate the beauty and wonder of the holiday season. Penguin puppets unwrap presents, ring bells, and toss tinsel. Santa's sleigh in a gentle snowfall segues smoothly into a playful group of Christmas-clad youngsters dancing to Tchaikovsky's 'Nutcracker.'",

When artistic director Thomas Leroy decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily, who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.",

She is first in line on sign-up day, only to see her odds of victory fall with the arrival of an unlikely yet formidable contender: 10-year-old Destiny. And that’s not all.

Facing three opponents, mocked by her stepdaughter Kaitlen and furious with her husband, Laura resolves to do whatever it takes to win.

The master of Collinwood Manor, Barnabas is rich, powerful and an inveterate playboy...until he makes the grave mistake of breaking the heart of Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). A witch, in every sense of the word, Angelique dooms him to a fate worse than death: turning him into a vampire, and then burying him alive. Two centuries later, Barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972. He returns to Collinwood Manor to find that his once-grand estate has fallen into ruin. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better...",

There is growing evidence that vampires deprived of an adequate blood supply are themselves evolving into wild, vile creatures that attack anyone and anything in order to survive.

In Berlin, capital of the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler proclaims that Germany will still achieve victory and orders his Generals and advisers to fight to the last man. 'Downfall' explores these final days of the Reich, where senior German leaders (such as Himmler and Goring) began defecting from their beloved Fuhrer, in an effort to save their own lives, while still others (Joseph Goebbels) pledge to die with Hitler. Hitler, himself, degenerates into a paranoid shell of a man, full of optimism one moment and suicidal depression the next. When the end finally does comes, and Hitler lies dead by his own hand, what is left of his military must find a way to end the killing that is the Battle of Berlin, and lay down their arms in surrender.",

To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes—a washed-up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi)—who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past.

Pero, the PUSS’N BOOTS, is making a bet with Gourmont, and influential man of the town, to make a tour around the world in only eighty days. “Pero, it’s impossible with the late restoration of the Kuez Canal, I dare say.” “It sure is! It says in the paper it would take a hundred and fifty days?” But Pero is determined, and gives his word of honor to fulfill the promise. “Ha, ha, ha … A green horn like you can’t go around the world in eighty days only? … Anyway, it’s interesting. I’ll gibe you all my property.” You’ve got a deal. Pero is to make a trip around the world and upon his return, stand on the top of the clock tower before the noon bell finishes its twelve strikes after eighty days. “Start!” Pero and his friends-Carter, a hippo, and two mice, a father and his son- set forth on their tour. “Stay with it.” “Never listen to Gourmont!” All the people in town expect Pero to knock Gourmont, who is always throwing his weight around, down a peg. Well, Gourmont is crafty enough to send Doctor Garigari-a wolf- to make trouble for them. He tries to destroy their car, and then orders a large fishing boat to swallow their submarine. On one occasion he hires three murderers to kill them, on another sets up a mammoth to crush them…On land, on the sea and in the air, he tries every possible means to hinder them. However, every time Pero and the three find themselves in a crisis, they unite their efforts to succeed to the limits of courage and tactfulness. They strive all their way-from Dondon-going down the Thames-by way of Madridd-Vinice-Hathens, the Kuez Canal-the Continent of Garabia-Torman-silk road-Pindia-Pongkong-the Missussuppi and the North Pole… At last they are now over Dondon. Meanwhile, Gourmont gets ahead of them and is in the clock tower and removes the stairs…shuts them up in a closet…speeds up the clock…He tries every possible thing. On the other hand, Pero and his friends overcome one pinch after another, till they are on the top of the tower before the clock strikes noon. “Hurray for Pero! You’ve done well!” “Gourmont has lost the bet! It serves him right!” All the people in town are celebrating. They can now enjoy peace without being threatened by Gourmont.",

However, every time Pero and the three find themselves in a crisis, they unite their efforts to succeed to the limits of courage and tactfulness. They strive all their way-from Dondon-going down the Thames-by way of Madridd-Vinice-Hathens, the Kuez Canal-the Continent of Garabia-Torman-silk road-Pindia-Pongkong-the Missussuppi and the North Pole… At last they are now over Dondon. Meanwhile, Gourmont gets ahead of them and is in the clock tower and removes the stairs…shuts them up in a closet…speeds up the clock…He tries every possible thing. On the other hand, Pero and his friends overcome one pinch after another, till they are on the top of the tower before the clock strikes noon. “Hurray for Pero! You’ve done well!” “Gourmont has lost the bet! It serves him right!” All the people in town are celebrating. They can now enjoy peace without being threatened by Gourmont.",

Blu is a domesticated Macaw who never learned to fly, living a comfortable life with his owner and best friend Linda in the small town of Moose Lake, Minnesota. Blu and Linda think he's the last of his kind, but when they learn about another Macaw who lives in Rio de Janeiro, they head to the faraway and exotic land to find Jewel, Blu's female counterpart. Not long after they arrive, Blu and Jewel are kidnapped by a group of bungling animal smugglers. With the help of street smart Jewel, and a group of wise-cracking and smooth-talking city birds, Blu escapes. Now, with his new friends by his side, Blu will have to find the courage to learn to fly, thwart the kidnappers who are hot on their trail, and return to Linda, the best friend a bird ever had.",

    "description":"David Burke is a small-time pot dealer whose clientele includes chefs and soccer moms, but no kids-after all, he has his scruples. So what could go wrong? Plenty. Preferring to keep a low profile for obvious reasons, he learns the hard way that no good deed goes unpunished when he tries to help out some local teens and winds up getting jumped by a trio of gutter punks. Stealing his stash and his cash, they leave him in major debt to his supplier, Brad. In order to wipe the slate clean-and maintain a clean bill of health-David must now become a big-time drug smuggler by bringing Brad's latest shipment in from Mexico. Twisting the arms of his neighbors, cynical stripper Rose and wannabe customer Kenny, and the tatted-and-pierced streetwise teen Casey, he devises a foolproof plan. One fake wife, two pretend kids and a huge, shiny RV later, the 'Millers' are headed south of the border for a Fourth of July weekend that is sure to end with a bang.",
